Coding challenges given on PO

Week 1: 
  - Coding Exercise 1. Almost - Palindrome
    A string is an almost-palindrome if, by changing only one character, you can make it a palindrome.
    Create a function that returns true if a string is an almost-palindrome and false otherwise.

  Write a function that returns the number of ways a person can climb n stairs, 
  where the person may only climb 1 or 2 steps at a time.

Week 2:
